We will use SQL Developer to connect to our new Database System with a primary and a standby database. 
You can run this tool from any desktop that has network connectivity to the Database System.

You can download SQL Developer from this link: [SQL Developer Home page](https://www.oracle.com/be/database/technologies/appdev/sqldeveloper-landing.html) 

When you first opened SQL Developer, the screen looks like this:
