# Test with ADG

Now we can run some testing with the ADG.

## Lab Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have already completed the following labs:

- Deploy Active Data Guard with LVM or ASM

## Step 1: Test transaction replication

1. From on-premise side, create a test user in orclpdb, and grant privileges to the user. You need  to check if the pdb is open.

```

2. Connect with testuser, create test table and insert a test record.

```

3. From cloud side, open the standby database as read only.

```

## Step 2: Test DML Redirection

Starting  with Oracle DB 19c, we can run DML operations on Active Data Guard standby databases. This enables you to occasionally execute DMLs on read-mostly applications on the standby database.

Automatic redirection of DML operations to the primary can be configured at the system level or the session level. The session level setting overrides the system level

1. From cloud side, connect to orclpdb as testuser. Test the DML before and after the DML Redirection is enabled.

```
SQL> insert into test values(2,'line2');
insert into test values(2,'line2')
            *
ERROR at line 1:
ORA-16000: database or pluggable database open for read-only access


SQL> ALTER SESSION ENABLE ADG_REDIRECT_DML;

Session altered.

SQL> insert into test values(2,'line2');

1 row created.

SQL> commit; 

Commit complete.

SQL> select * from test;

	 A B
---------- --------------------
	 2 line2
	 1 line1

SQL> exit

2. From on-premise side, connect to orclpdb as testuser. Check the records in the test table.

```
SQL> select * from test;

	 A B
---------- --------------------
	 2 line2
	 1 line1

SQL> exit

## Step 3: Switchover to the Cloud 

At any time, you can manually execute a Data Guard switchover (planned event) or failover (unplanned event). Customers may also choose to automate Data Guard failover by configuring Fast-Start failover. Switchover and failover reverse the roles of the databases in a Data Guard configuration â€“ the standby in the cloud becomes primary and the original on-premise primary becomes a standby database. Refer to Oracle MAA Best Practices for additional information on Data Guard role transitions. 

Switchovers are always a planned event that guarantees no data is lost. To execute a switchover, perform the following in Data Guard Broker 

1. Connect DGMGRL from on-premise side, validate the standby database to see if Ready For Switchover is Yes. Replace `ORCL_nrt1d4` with your standby db unique name.

```
[oracle@workshop ~]$ dgmgrl sys/Ora_DB4U@orcl
